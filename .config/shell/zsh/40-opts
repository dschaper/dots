setopt NO_BEEP

## Changing Directories

setopt AUTO_CD
# If a command is issued that can't be executed as a normal command, and the command is the name 
# of a directory, perform the cd command to that directory. 
	
setopt PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS
# Don't push multiple copies of the same directory onto the directory stack. 
	
setopt PUSHD_SILENT
# Do not print the directory stack after pushd or popd. 
	
setopt PUSHD_TO_HOME
# Have pushd with no arguments act like 'pushd $HOME'. 

## Completion

setopt ALWAYS_TO_END
# If a completion is performed with the cursor within a word, and a full completion is inserted, the cursor 
# is moved to the end of the word. That is, the cursor is moved to the end of the word if either a single 
# match is inserted or menu completion is performed. 

setopt AUTO_LIST
# Automatically list choices on an ambiguous completion.

setopt AUTO_MENU
unsetopt MENU_COMPLETE
# Automatically use menu completion after the second consecutive request for completion, for example by 
# pressing the tab key repeatedly. This option is overridden by MENU_COMPLETE.

setopt COMPLETE_ALIASES
# Prevents aliases on the command line from being internally substituted before completion is attempted. 
# The effect is to make the alias a distinct command for completion purposes. 

unsetopt COMPLETE_IN_WORD
# If unset, the cursor is set to the end of the word if completion is started. Otherwise it stays there and 
# completion is done from both ends. 

setopt LIST_AMBIGUOUS
# This option works when AUTO_LIST or BASH_AUTO_LIST is also set. If there is an unambiguous prefix to insert 
# on the command line, that is done without a completion list being displayed; in other words, auto-listing 
# behaviour only takes place when nothing would be inserted. 

setopt LIST_TYPES
# When listing files that are possible completions, show the type of each file with a trailing identifying mark. 

## History

setopt EXTENDED_HISTORY
# Save each command's beginning timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) and the duration (in seconds) to the 
# history file. The format of this prefixed data is: 
# ':<beginning time>:<elapsed seconds>:<command>'. 

setopt HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST
# If the internal history needs to be trimmed to add the current command line, setting this option will cause the 
# oldest history event that has a duplicate to be lost before losing a unique event from the list. You should be 
# sure to set the value of HISTSIZE to a larger number than SAVEHIST in order to give you some room for the 
# duplicated events, otherwise this option will behave just like HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS once the history fills up
# with unique events. 

setopt HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS
# When searching for history entries in the line editor, do not display duplicates of a line previously found, even 
# if the duplicates are not contiguous.

setopt HIST_IGNORE_DUPS
# Do not enter command lines into the history list if they are duplicates of the previous event. 

setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE
# Remove command lines from the history list when the first character on the line is a space, or when one of the
# expanded aliases contains a leading space. Note that the command lingers in the internal history until the next
# command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the line. If you want to make it 
# vanish right away without entering another command, type a space and press return.

setopt HIST_NO_STORE
# Remove the history (fc -l) command from the history list when invoked. Note that the command lingers in the
# internal history until the next command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the
# line. 

setopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS
# Remove superfluous blanks from each command line being added to the history list. 

## Input/Output

setopt ALIASES
# Expand aliases

setopt CORRECT
setopt HASH_LIST_ALL
# Try to correct the spelling of commands. Note that, when the HASH_LIST_ALL option is not set or when some 
# directories in the path are not readable, this may falsely report spelling errors the first time some commands
# are used. 
# The shell variable CORRECT_IGNORE may be set to a pattern to match words that will never be offered as
# corrections. 

setopt MARK_DIRS
# Append a trailing '/' to all directory names resulting from filename generation (globbing). 

# vim:ft=zsh ts=2 sw=2 sts=2 et fenc=utf-8
